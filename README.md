# DevOps Learning Journey

Welcome to my **DevSecOps Learning Journey**! This repository serves as a documentation and showcase of my progress as I transition from a career in **Cybersecurity** and **DevOps**, where I have over 5 years of experience, to becoming a proficient DevSecOps Engineer. My strong foundation in DevOps and cybersecurity principles provides a unique perspective as I delve into the DevOps domain. Below, you'll find the detailed roadmap I am following, broken down into a 3-month plan. The repository will include scripts, configurations, and projects that reflect my learning.

Here's your learning plan adapted for a **DevSecOps** focus:
